# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis attempts to help one understand the dynamics of Amazon reviews, and specifically those written by paid reviewers in a program such as Amazon Vine. It is important to consider whether reviews conducted by paid reviewers tend to be significantly different than those conducted by unpaid reviewers.

## Results
There are 4291 total Vine reviews and 1781706 total non-Vine reviews.
There are 1607 5-Star Vine reviews and 1025317 5-Star non-Vine reviews.
Roughly 37.5% of Vine reviews were 5-Star compared to 57.5% of non-Vine reviews being 5-Star.

## Summary
According to these figures, there doesn't appear to be a significant positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. In fact, the Vine program showed a lower 5-Star percentage than did non-Vine reviews.

Additional analysis that could be done with the dataset would be trying to find certain video games with multiple instances of both Vine and non-Vine reviews to directly compare these reviews. It would be easier to determine any existing bias given this additional information.
